## 创建数据库
创建数据库失败， 报错：

解决:数据库名称不能和主机名相同， 修改主机名解决。

## DATA CAPTURE
数据库运行缓慢， 存在等待的内容是： ALTER TABLE t_table_name DATA CAPTURE NONE

以下是查询出来的 关于DATA CAPTURE解释：
For updates, DB2 records undo/ redo records in the log. There’s an option on a CREATE or ALTER TABLE definition called DATA CAPTURE. The two settings are DATA CAPTURE CHANGES or DATA CAPTURE NONE, the default being NONE. For inserts and deletes, DB2 is always recording a full image of the row affected, but for updates, DB2 can minimize the data recorded in the log. The DATA CAPTURE CHANGES feature tells DB2 you’re planning to use the log information for some sort of data replication or log analysis. There are several data replication tools that can read log records or use a DB2 log exit to replicate database changes to other databases or processes. In order for the replication to work properly for updates, it needs the entire before and after image of the rows changed. So, DATA CAPTURE CHANGES will cause DB2 to log the entire before and after images of rows changed via update statements in the undo/redo records in the log.

DB2 will minimize the information logged during updates if DATA CAPTURE NONE is set for a table. A good performance practice is to specify DATA CAPTURE NONE for a table unless you’re specifically planning on replicating the table via a product that reads log records.
